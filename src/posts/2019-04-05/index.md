##Â Introduction

JavaScript is a great language to learn. It has many applications and is used everywhere - in the browser, on the backend, for creating both desktop apps and mobile apps! If you want to learn the basics, then this a great place to start. In this post we will be outlining JavaScript best practices and some common ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) features. We'll be covering:
- Comments
- Variables
- Types
- Scope
- Conditionals
- Loops
- Functions
- Objects
- Classes

So why should you learn JavaScript? Here are just a few reasons:
- It is one of the fundamental building blocks of web development, alongside HTML and CSS, so if you're
planning to create websites or web apps, it is an essential.
- It can be used outside of web development for building native mobile apps (e.g. NativeScript, React Native)
and desktop apps (e.g. Electron, NW.js).
- It is the most used programming language in the world (sources: <a href="https://githut.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHut</a>, <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018#most-popular-technologies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stack Overflow survey</a>) and without a doubt one of the most popular.
- It has a thriving community that offers lots of support and resources. For example, it has the largest Stack Overflow
community.

To get started, let's look at an extract from the [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
```
"JavaScript is a prototype based, multi-paradigm, dynamic language, supporting object-orientated,
imperative and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles."
```
Hopefully the above doesn't make any sense to you, which is why we're covering the basics of JavaScript! We'll return to this definition at the end of the post, and, equipped with our knowledge, we'll tackle it piece by piece. 

So let's get started! 
## Comments
Comments are pieces of code that don't actually do anything. That's not to say they don't have a purpose.

## Variables

## Types

## Scope

```
"JavaScript is a prototype based, multi-paradigm, dynamic language, supporting object-orientated,
imperative and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles."
```

Let's break down what that means:
1. Prototype based: Instead of being class-based, where classes and instances are distinct (like Java, for example), all objects in JavaScript are instances.
2. Multi-paradigm: JavaScript supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-orientated, imperative and declarative paradigms.
3. Dynamic language: In JavaScript, the type of variables is not known at runtime, unlike static languages.
4. Supporting object-orientated, imperative and declarative styles: See 2.
