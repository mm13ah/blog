So you want to learn JavaScript?

If you've never studied JavaScript before then this blog post is for.

In this post we will cover:
- Types

Printing Data:
In languages like Python and C++, printing data to the terminal is a common requirement. So 
how do we do this in JavaScript? It's a little different to the methods in the languages mentioned
above. Because JavaScript was built to work with the browser, we use the command

```js
const hello = 'world';

```
