So you want to learn JavaScript?

If you've never studied JavaScript before then this blog post is for.

In this post we will cover:
- Types

Printing Data:
In languages like Python and C++, printing data to the terminal is a common requirement. So 
how do we do this in JavaScript? It's a little different to the methods in the languages mentioned
above. Because JavaScript was built to work with the browser, we use the command
<pre>console.log(data);</pre>

```js
{
      resolve: `gatsby-source-filesystem`,
      options: {
        path: `${__dirname}/src/pages`,
        name: "pages",
      },
    }
