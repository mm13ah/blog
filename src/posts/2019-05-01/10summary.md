## Summary
We've covered a lot in this blog post. We've looked at how we declare, initialise and assign variables. We've seen the different data types that are available in JavaScript. We've covered programming concepts like conditionals, loops and functions, and seen how scope works. We've looked at objects, which are a fundamental part of JavaScript - we've seen how we can define and access object properties and methods. And lastly we've looked at how we can use classes as templates for objects.
