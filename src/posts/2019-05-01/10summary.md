## Summary
We've covered a lot in this blog post. We've looked at how we declare, initialise and assign variables. We've seen the different data types that are available in JavaScript. We've covered programming concepts like conditionals, loops and functions, and how scope works. We've looked at what objects are and how we can define object properties and methods. And lastly we've looked at how we can use classes as templates for objects.
